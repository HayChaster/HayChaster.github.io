To be good at something, first you must learn the basics. When practicing anything from sports, to math, to coding, there is a step in
which you start. For coding the first step understanding what coding is with the syntax. When many people fail to do something, it would 
usually be because their fundamentals were not good enough, for coding a simple semicolon could crash your code and give an error. There 
is nothing wrong with trying to improve on the fundamentals, even professionals forget the basics, and get frustrated when dealing with 
simple errors. Most people start to debug code by thinking of complicated algorithms but don't realize that the solution is simple, but we 
skip the simple stuff because we "think" we couldn't do a simple error.

Learning and understanding something like ESLint with IntelliJ which fixes all my little errors and keeps my code neat, expands my basic 
knowledge of programming, making me more efficient. Learning by making mistakes and by thinking about them make my debugging skills improve, 
by making my code nice and readable I am able to understand the complicated errors that I could make in the future. The saying "Everything 
in life goes back to the basics." by Kron Gracie is a true and renowned as an important life skill to understand. I been programming for 
as little as 5 years and yet when I get the chance I would always practice on my placements of brackets and parentheses. As in life lessons 
if I ever get stuck, I will remember to take a deep breath and think about the fundamentals.
