When asking for help many times there are reasons for misconception, usually when people ask the questions they do not think about what they are asking. If communication is bad, then the resulting output would be wrong or different from what the client wants. In the past for traveling to the moon scientist would come up with answers to questions, but bad communication could result in a failure in the mission which could cause millions of dollars. Answering a question is hard but understanding the question from top to bottom is even harder especially for Computer Science majors, if you don't know the question, you don’t know the answer.

Examples of bad questions to ask usually to involve, keywords that don't make sense in a sentence, copy and paste questions from student’s homework, and questions that are off topic. Where the person who asked the question probably didn't read about it and is lazy only looking for an answer.

Examples of smart questions usually involve information which could help understand the question. Another example would be code that could be copied and keeps updating the form even after the solution is found, to help other people with the same problems
