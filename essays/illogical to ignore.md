When asking for help many times there are reasons for misconception, usually when people ask the questions they do not think about what they are asking. If communication is bad then the resulting output would be wrong or different from what the client wants. In the past for traveling to the moon scientist would come up with answers to questions, but bad communication could result in a failure in the mission which could cause millions of dollars. Answering a question is hard but understanding the question from top to bottom is even harder especially for Computer Science majors, if you don't know the question, you definetly don't know the answer.
