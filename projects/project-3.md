Practice with C# and modeling using an application called Unreal Engine. By doing so I get a feel for 3D models and how they interact with other models, this is a personal project that involves self learning on the application. There are my pre made models but I do fix some models to fit the needs that I want, I also connect with networks to help provide better development skills. 

I work mostly on environment modeling and but I want to practice more on coding to make custome animations and interactions.
