I took ICS 111 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa at the spring semester in 2016. In the course we were programming in Java which 
was also my second programming language I learned after C, We used a library that was created by a graduate student which was called EZ library. This was our first project as we made a game which could involved interaction with images, by making a "hitbox" around the objects. My project was individual work, so I set up the design for the program which involved creating classes and objects. My project got recognition from the professor and the TA, which made me want to improve on my work as a programmer.
