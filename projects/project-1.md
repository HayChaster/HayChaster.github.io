I took ICS 111 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in the spring semester of 2016. In the course we were programming in Java which was also my second programming language after C, We used a library that was created by a graduate student which was called EZ library. This was our first project as we made a game which could involve interaction with images, by making a "hitbox" around the objects.


My project was individual work, so I set up the design for the program which involved creating classes and objects. My project got recognition from the professor and the TA, which made me want to improve on my work as a programmer. Editing the right ratios, syncing the music and sounds made it informative in how the little things impact the whole experience. Also the making of this game made me realize my passion for creating code resulting in something fun.
