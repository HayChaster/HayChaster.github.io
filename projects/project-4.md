GrubNGo is an app that was created from a team of University students in ICS 314. The app was created to help students who were unable to find food vendors that avaliable at the time. The Goal was to give students and professors places to eat, also a place where they sell food that the user would want to eat and enjoy. The project was created with Github using JavaScript, semantic and programming pattern. There is a twitter feed which is linked to the main landing page that is following all vendors, every update is going to show in the main landing page. With an interactive map to follow and show locations of the destinated vendor, showing how far and every turn.

One part of the GrubNGo app that I was contributing in was making a homepage for the vendor that was distributing goods. By giving the vendor the ability to add food, drinks, add a picture and edit the menu. By doing so the vendor can fix anything in the menu as long as they sign into the database. The vendor home page can only be seen from the vendor and admin, users are unable to change anything in the vendor homepage.
